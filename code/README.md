# A Fake Twitter but with Happy Thoughts! 

This week we practiced on fetching API with useEffect to render a list of public posts. The task was also being able to like and post a message using a form.

I was able to finish the project several days before the hand-in so I'm happy with the result but I realized that I have to improve and understand some basic concepts in Programmation like Fetch API, Objects and how UseState and UseEffect works in React.

It was a good project and I enjoyed doing it.
